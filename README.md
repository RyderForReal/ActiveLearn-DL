# ActiveLearn-DL
Have you ever wanted to download an eBook from Pearson ActiveLearn to, for example, read and edit it on something like a ReMarkable?
Well, I have, so that's why I created this repository.
If you'd like to improve on my shitty code, you're more than welcome to.

I hope it goes without saying that I disapprove of the use of this tool for illegitimate purposes like piracy, but I'd nonetheless like to ask you to not use this tool for things like that.

The latest version of this repository is available on my [GitLab](https://gitlab.ryderg.net/RyderForNow/activelearn-dl).
